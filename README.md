### I'm Manolo, I work with backend systems in Go and Python.

I am currently on my way to finish the Backend Developer path in [Boot.Dev](https://boot.dev) and a Masters in Software Engineering
at WGU focusing on Domain Driven Design.

I'm interested in building backend systems that have a focus on scalability and efficiency, without forgetting the human
aspect of designing and developing software (probably the hardest part), by being proficient in industry standards of Project 
Management Methodologies such as Agile, SCRUM and even Waterfall (people still use it I swear).

I'm looking for a new full time role where I can apply my skills, but most importantly, to surround myself with people
that are way better programmers than I am, so that I can learn from them and contribute towards building some cool stuff!

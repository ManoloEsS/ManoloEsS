### I'm Manolo, I work with backend systems in Go and Python.

I am currently on my way to completing the Backend Developer path in [Boot.Dev](https://boot.dev) and earning a Master's in Software Engineering
at WGU, focusing on Domain Driven Design.

I'm interested in building backend systems minding the human aspect of designing and developing software (probably the hardest part),
by striving to be proficient in industry-standard project management methodologies.

I'm looking for a new full-time role where I can apply my skills and surround myself with programmers that are better than I am,
so that I can learn from them and contribute towards building some cool stuff!
